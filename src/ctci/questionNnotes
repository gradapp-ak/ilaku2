//DataStructures
Stack
Array

Tree
    Heap (min-heap/max heap)
    n-ary tree (can have more than 2 child)
    Binary tree
    Binary search tree
    Balanced tree (Have to check) (AVL,Redblack)
    Complete Binary tree (uniformly filled left to right)
    + Full binary tree (All the nodes have 0 or 2 children) = Perfect binary trees
    Tries (Prefix tree)

Graphs
    Bidirectional Search
    Topological Sort

//Algorithm techniques
  2 pointers
    leading and lagging pointers
        lagging pointers dynamic/resetting or fixed follower
    left and right pointers
    fast and slow pointers

  Scan twice
    Scan the array/linkedList twice. First time to infer meta data like
     length of an linkedlist and use that to solve the problem
